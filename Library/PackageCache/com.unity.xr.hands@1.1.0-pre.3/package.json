    "changelog": "### Added\n\n- The `HandVisualizer` sample now opts into using optimized controls in the Input System. You must be on at least version 1.5.0 of the Input System package for this to have an effect.\n\n### Changed\n\n- `MetaAimHand` and `MetaAimFlags` have been moved outside of the `MetaHandTrackingAim` type and moved from the `UnityEngine.XR.Hands.OpenXR` namespace to `UnityEngine.XR.Hands`. The same input bindings will work the same as before.\n- The HandVisualizer sample meshes has been updated.\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Fixed issue where OpenXR would incorrectly report joints as having updated when they weren't actually tracked that frame. `XRHandSubsystem`'s `trackingAcquired` and `trackingLost`, as well as `XRHand.isTracked`, will now work as expected.\n- Fixed lifetime of `GameObject`s in `HandVisualizer` sample.\n- Reinstated the validation rule that the Meta Touch Interaction Profile is required in the OpenXR Interaction Profiles list."
